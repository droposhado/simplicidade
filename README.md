# Simplicidade

Simplicidade is a theme based on [Boostrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/) that aims to use the vanilla framework with a simple design that prioritizes content, with a single column and metadata necessary for identification in case of CDN use.

Has the features below:

- Dynamic data-based pages ([data folder](https://gohugo.io/templates/data-templates/))
- Pages translated in:
  - en
  - pt-br
- Template to pages:
  - linktree
  - contact
  - [now](https://nownownow.com/about)
- Local assets
  - Boostrap 5
  - Bootstrap Icons 1.4
  - [Syntax highlight](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/), currently using [dracula](https://xyproto.github.io/splash/docs/dracula.html) with modification on comments to pass on [pa11y](https://pa11y.org/)
